Born on May 12, 1820, in Florence, Italy (hence her name), she grew up in a wealthy British family that valued education.\nFlorence Nightingale rose to prominence during the Crimean War (1853–1856), where she led a team of nurses to care for wounded British soldiers. She found military hospitals in horrifying conditions—unsanitary, overcrowded, and disease-ridden. Through meticulous organization, hygiene practices, and compassion, she drastically reduced the death rate from 42% to 2%."

Currently, that’s R-4.5.0 and RStudio-2025.05.0.\nWe also strongly recommend all participants to install the development tools to avoid potential issues installing packages.\n\nInstalling R\nDownload the pre-compiled binary for your OS from https://cloud.r-project.org/ and install. More specifically:\nFor Windows\nClick “Download R for Windows”, then “base”, then “Download R-4.5.0 for Windows”. This will download an .exe file; once downloaded, open to start the installation.\nFor Mac\nClick “Download R for macOS”, then “R-4.5.0-arm64.pkg” (the first option) to download the installer for Macs with Apple Silicon chips or “R-4.5.0-x86_64.pkg” (the second option) to download the installer for Macs with Intel chips. Run the installer to complete installation.\nFor Linux\nClick “Download R for Linux”. Instructions on installing are given for Debian, Fedora, Redhat, Suse and Ubuntu distributions. Where there is a choice, install both r-base and r-base-dev.\n\n\nInstalling R Studio Desktop (Open Source Edition)\nDownloads are available from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nDownload the relevant installer either under the “Install RStudio” header or, scrolling down the page, from the ‘All installers and Tarballs’ section. Run the installer to complete installation.\nFor Windows with no admin rights\nDownload the .zip source archive under “Zip/Tarballs”. Extract the files to a folder where you have write access, e.g. C:\\Users\\username\\RStudio. In this folder, open the bin directory and find the RStudio program: it is named rstudio.exe, but the file extension will typically be hidden, so look for rstudio. Right-click this executable to create a desktop shortcut. Double-click the executable or use the shortcut to open.\nFor all other operating systems\nDownload the relevant installer for your OS listed under “Installers for Supported Platforms”. Run the installer to complete installation.\n\n\nDevelopment Tools\nSome additional tools may be required to compile R packages from source.\nFor Windows with no admin rights\nDownload the latest (recommended) Rtools installer, Rtools.exe, from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. Run the installer keeping the default settings.\nFor Windows with admin rights\nDownload the latest Rtools installer, Rtools.exe, from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/. Run the installer making the following selections: keep the default settings for the installation location and components to install; check the box to add rtools to the system PATH.\nFor Mac\nInstall XCode. Either:\n\nDownload and install XCode from the Mac AppStore: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12\n\nOr for a smaller download size:\n\nRegister as an Apple Developer (free) here: https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/\nDownload the Command Line Tools for XCode appropriate for the version of OS X you are running from here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/\n\nFor Linux\nIf you installed r-base-dev, when installing R, you should have all you need to build packages from source. Otherwise return to the instructions for installing R for your distribution and follow the instructions there to install the additional tools."

While analysts are typically trained to work with structured, numeric data in table formats, a significant portion of today’s data boom involves unstructured, text-based information.\n\nUnstructured data represents 80-90% of all new enterprise data, according to Gartner.\n\nFurthermore, it’s growing three times faster than structured data."

    "text": "About the Dataset\n\nThe BBC News dataset contains three key columns:\n\nTitle – the headline of each news article\nDescription – a brief summary or excerpt from the article\nCategory – the labeled topic (e.g., Business, Sport, etc.)\n\nFor this project, we focus on the Description column as the primary source of text. This is where we perform all of our text cleaning and preprocessing — removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, eliminating stop words, and so on.\nOnce the topic model is built, we use the Category column as a benchmark to evaluate how well our model’s discovered topics align with the actual labeled categories. This gives us a way to check the quality and accuracy of our model.\n\n\nglimpse(bbc)\n\nRows: 2,225\nColumns: 4\n$ ...1        &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, …\n$ Title       &lt;chr&gt; \"India calls for fair trade rules\", \"Sluggish economy hits…\n$ Description &lt;chr&gt; \"india attend g7 meet seven lead industrialis nation frida…\n$ Category    &lt;chr&gt; \"Business\", \"Business\", \"Business\", \"Business\", \"Business\"…"

    "text": "Key Importance of Topic Modeling\n\nUncovering Hidden Themes:\nTopic modeling helps discover latent themes and patterns within unstructured text data that might otherwise be missed, providing a deeper understanding of large datasets.\nEfficient Information Retrieval and Organization:\nIt automatically organizes and groups documents by their main themes, making it easier to find relevant information and creating a manageable structure for large text collections.\nSupporting Data-Driven Decisions:\nBy identifying prevalent topics in customer reviews, social media, or research, organizations can make more informed decisions to improve products, services, and strategies."

    "text": "BBC News: Ever wondered what the news was really talking about beneath the headlines?\n\nWe’ll be working with the BBC News dataset, a collection of 2225 news articles published between 2004 and 2005, covering five major categories: Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sport, and Technology.\nThe goal of this project is to combine all the articles into one dataset and apply unsupervised topic modeling to uncover the hidden, underlying themes within the news stories. By analyzing the text, we’ll reveal the most prominent topics that dominated the public narrative during that time — all without manually assigning any labels."
