## Why Data Visualization Matters

-   Humans process visuals 60,000x faster than text

-   Visuals simplify complex data

-   Helps identify trends, outliers, and patterns

-   Supports data-driven decisions

## Real-World Example:

COVID-19 dashboards helped governments track and respond to infection spikes and vaccinations.

# Bridging the Gap Between Data and Decisions {.inverse}

**Problem:** Data is abundant, but insights are scarce.

**Solution:** Visualization bridges the gap between raw data and strategic action.

**Outcome:** Simplifies storytelling and supports real-time decisions.

# What is R and Why Use It? {.inverse}

## R

-   Free and open-source statistical language

-   Used in academia and business

-   Integrates data wrangling, analysis, and visualization

*Key Visualization Packages:*

`ggplot2`

`plotly`

`shiny`

## Understanding Visualization Types

| Chart Type   | Best For                     |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Line Chart   | Trends over time             |
| Bar Chart    | Comparing categories         |
| Scatter Plot | Correlations, relationships  |
| Maps         | Geospatial data              |
| Dashboard    | Monitoring KPIs in real-time |

*Tip:* Choose simplicity and clarity over complexity.

# Case Study {.inverse}

## Academic Use Case â€“ Education Access

**Dataset:** World Bank (Literacy vs Internet Access)

**Visualization:** Scatter plot showing socio-economic development.

**Insight:** Nigeria lags behind Kenya and Egypt in internet penetration despite comparable literacy rates.
