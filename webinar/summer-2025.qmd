# Webinar Overview

In today‚Äôs world, data is everywhere‚Äîbut data alone doesn‚Äôt drive decisions. Communicating data through clear, purposeful, and accessible visualisations is an essential skill for anyone working with data‚Äîwhether you're a scientist, analyst, researcher, or manager. When well-crafted, the insights we extract and how clearly we communicate them truly make an impact. However, poor design choices can hinder understanding or, worse, mislead the audience‚Äîintentionally or not.
